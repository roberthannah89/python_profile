CHATGPT 4 PROMPT
Generate a good python profile that imports that 50 most common python modules with their standard abbreviations. 
But split the profile into logical groupings of modules, and give a description with # at the end of the line that explains what each package does. 
However display this as a single code block containing many paragraphs. 
Include the appropriate package when a package is deprecated. E.g. cv2.
